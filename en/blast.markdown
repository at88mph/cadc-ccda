Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) archive.

<p>
  
    BLAST is a 2-m telescope that has conducted a series of sub-mm
    imaging surveys at wavelengths 250--500 um, starting in 2005.
    Built and flown by a collaboration of universities from Canada,
    the USA, the UK and Mexico, the telescope initially used a
    prototype of the SPIRE camera for the Herschel satellite, but
    since 2010 it has had unique polarimetry capabilities added.
