  Survey (IRIS) collection.

  IRIS provides reprocessed 12, 25, 60 and 100 micron images taken by
  the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) over 10 months in
  1983. Most light observed at these wavelengths is thermal emission
  from interstellar dust at temperatures of several 10s of Kelvins, as
  well as some warmer dust in the vicinity of young stars. These data
  products represent a major improvement over the latest versions
  provided by the IRAS team (the ISSA team) in terms of minimized
  striping and superior calibration. Large-scale information,
  including the absolute calibration, are obtained from observations
  by the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) and
  observations by the COsmic Background Explorer (COBE). Unlike an
  earlier, similar combination of IRAS and DIRBE data by Schlegel et
  al. (1998), IRIS retains the native IRAS resolution, with superior
  small-scale and point-source calibration (particularly at 100
  microns).
