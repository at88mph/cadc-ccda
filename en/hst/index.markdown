<p>
The HST archive at CADC contains all public (non-proprietary) HST data in raw and processed formats.
Standard HST archive products from the active instruments (ACS, COS, FGS, STIS, WFC3) are kept current by reprocessing with improved calibration reference files and algorithms.
Data from legacy instruments (FOC, FOS, HRS, HSP, NICMOS, WFPC, WFPC2) have gone through a final calibration run and are not expected to change in future.
</p>
<p>
The HST archives at CADC, <a id="ESAC" rel="external" href="https://archives.esac.esa.int/hst/" class="ui-link">ESAC</a> and <a id="MAST" rel="external" href="https://archive.stsci.edu" class="ui-link">MAST</a> Use the same <a id="CAOM" rel="external" href="https://www.opencadc.org/caom2" class="ui-link">CAOM</a> data model to store HST metadata. The collections are synchronized such that an identical processing version of each file is hosted at all three sites. In the event that a file is temporarily unavailable at one site, the user request will be automatically re-routed to an archive where the file is available.
</p>
<p>
The HST collection includes the recently released <a id="HAP" rel="external" href="https://archive.stsci.edu/contents/newsletters/december-2020/hap-single-visit-mosaics-now-available" class="ui-link">Hubble Advanced Products (HAP)</a> for ACS and WFC3 that will have regular reprocessing as more data becomes available.
</p>
<p>
CADC currently also stores and serves enhanced data products from the  <b>Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) </b> for ACS, NICMOS, WFC3 and WFPC2. The HLA is a joint project of STScI, ESAC and CADC.</p>
