  WALLABY is one of the key surveys on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP).  It aims to use the powerful widefield phased-array technology of ASKAP to observe most of the Southern sky in the 21-cm line of neutral
   hydrogen (or HI) at 30-arcsec and 4 km/s spatial and spectral resolutions, thereby detecting and imaging the gas distribution in hundreds of thousands of external galaxies in the local Universe.  The full project 
   expects to observe the sky for over 8800 hours over 5 years starting in November 2022; to date, hundreds of sources have been detected and characterised during the WALLABY pilot survey phase.

  The CADC WALLABY data collection consists of WALLABY enhanced data products.  These include detected sources and kinematic models.  Access to these products are provided as part of the Canadian Initiative for Radio 
  Astronomy Data Analysis (CIRADA) program led by a consortium of Canadian universities, in partnership with NRAO and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC), and funded by the Canada Foundation for Innovation.  
  Access to the full mosaiced cubes is available through CASDA (CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive) partners.
