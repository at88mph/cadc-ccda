<p>
    This page provides access to the Near-Earth Object Surveillance Satellite (NEOSSat) data collection.
</p>

<p>
    NEOSSat is a nimble Canadian space telescope supporting a dual mission of space situational awareness and
    space astronomy. It offers all-sky target acquisition, precise Fine Point control, a Track Rate mode for moving
    targets, and an extended baffle for low solar elongation observations. From a polar-orbiting platform, direct
    parallax measurement of near-Earth objects can be obtained.  NEOSSat is well suited for the astrometric and
    photometric study of solar system bodies. NEOSSat also enables continual photometry for asteroseismology,
    exoplanet transits and other transients.  The instrument is a 15-cm Maksutov telescope and CCD
    with 3”/pixel scale and 0.85° field of view.
