    This list of astronomy meetings was originally compiled by Liz Bryson,
    the now retired librarian of the
    <a rel="external" href="https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu">Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation</a>,
    from 1996 to 2011.
    The list is currently archived and maintained by the <a href="/en/">Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC)</a> 
    of <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/research-centres/herzberg-astronomy-astrophysics-research-centre">NRC Herzberg</a>.
    Use the Search menu to view meetings by month or year or by keyword.
    Included with each entry of the Meetings List are links to the meeting
    web page, contact e-mail addresses, and abstracts provided by NASA's
    Astrophysics Data System (ADS) if, and when they are available.

    To add a meeting to the Meetings List or modify information for an
    existing meeting entry use the Submit or Edit Meeting menu. Fill
    out the displayed form and submit it. For new meetings CADC staff
    will check that the meeting warrants addition to the Meetings List
    and will then add it to the database as soon as possible.
