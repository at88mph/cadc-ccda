<p>  
    These pages present calibrated and stacked data from the
    Suprime-Cam mosaic imager on
    the <a href="https://subarutelescope.org" rel="external">Subaru
    Telescope</a>
    operated by the <a href="https://www.nao.ac.jp/" rel="external">National Astronomical Observatory of Japan</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The Suprime-Cam archive presents a wealth of data. Suprime-Cam was a 10-CCD wide-field mosaic imager
    with a 34Ã—27 arcminute field of view that was operated from 1999 until 2017.  Details of Suprime-Cam can be found in
    the <a href="https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/SCam/index.html" rel="external">Subaru Telescope instrument page.</a>
</p>
<p>
    There are over 82000 images in the collection taken from an 8-m telescope on Maunakea, one of the
    finest astronomical sites on earth. The images have been processed,
    calibrated, and stacked to produce the Suprime-Cam Legacy Archive
    (SCLA). The SCLA provides science ready data products, both fully calibrated
    individiual images and stacked images.
</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Subaru Telescope holds responsibility of all raw data and provides the raw data to CADC.</li>
  <li>CADC processes raw data and provides the products through this archive service.</li>
  <li>CADC runs this archive service and Subaru Telescope/ADC supports CADC to improve the service.</li>
</ul>

        from the STARS data archive system, which is operated by Subaru
        Telescope and Astronomy Data Center at National Astronomical
        Observatory of Japan. The data were processed by Suprime-Cam
        Legacy Archive, a service provided by CADC in cooperation with
