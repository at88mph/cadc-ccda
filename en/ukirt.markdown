<p>
  This page gives you access to the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope
  (UKIRT) collection.
</p>

<p>
  UKIRT is a 3.8-m infrared telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i, that has
  been operating since 1979. Despite its age, it remains one of the
  most powerful ground-based facilities for dedicated observations at
  these wavelengths. It is presently operated by the Joint Astronomy
  Centre (JAC), although it is currently in a period of transition to
  new ownership.

<p>
  This collection, hosted at the CADC, contains data from the
  following instruments: CGS3, CGS4, IRCAM3, Michelle, UFTI and
  UIST. It does not, however, host data from the wide-field imager
  WFCAM. To search the available data, use the Search link at the
  left. Additional information, including links to WFCAM data, may
  continue to be found at the old UKIRT page hosted by the JAC.
