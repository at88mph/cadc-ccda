<p>
The JWST archive at CADC contains all public (non-proprietary) JWST data in raw and processed formats.
Standard JWST archive products are kept current by reprocessing with improved calibration reference files and algorithms.
</p>
<p>
The JWST archives at CADC, <a id="ESAC" rel="external" href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/jwst/">ESAC</a> and <a id="MAST" rel="external" href="https://archive.stsci.edu">MAST</a> Use the same <a id="CAOM" rel="external" href="https://www.opencadc.org/caom2">CAOM</a> data model to store JWST metadata. The collections are synchronized such that an identical processing version of each file is hosted at all three sites. In the event that a file is temporarily unavailable at one site, the user request will be automatically re-routed to an archive where the file is available.
