<p>
    This page provides access to the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) data collection.
</p>

<p>
    VLASS is a synoptic, all-sky radio survey with a unique combination of high angular resolution (≈2".5),
    sensitivity (a 1σ goal of 70 µJy/beam in the coadded data), full linear Stokes polarimetry, time domain coverage,
    and wide bandwidth (2–4 GHz). The first observations began in September 2017, and observing is projected to finish
    in 2024. VLASS uses approximately 5500 hours of time on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the
    whole sky visible to the VLA (Declination &gt; −40&deg;), a total of 33 885 deg2. The data is taken in three epochs to allow
    the discovery of variable and transient radio sources.
</p>

<p>
    Enhanced VLASS data products are provided as part of the Canadian Initiative for Radio Astronomy Data Analysis
    (CIRADA) program led by a consortium of Canadian universities, in partnership with NRAO and the
    Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC), and funded by the Canada Foundation for Innovation.
