<p> The JCMT Science Archive (JSA), a collaboration between
the <a href="/en/" class="ui-link">CADC</a>
and <a rel="external" href="http://www.eaobservatory.org" class="ui-link">EAO</a>, is the official
distribution site for observational data obtained with the 
<a rel="external" href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/" class="ui-link">James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)</a> on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
</p>

<p> The JSA search interface is provided by the
CADC <a href="/en/search/?collection=JCMT&amp;noexec=true" class="ui-link">Search</a>
tool, which provides generic access to the complete set of telescopic
data archived at the CADC.  Help on the use of this tool is provided
via tooltips. For additional information on instrument capabilities
and data reduction, please consult
the <a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/instrumentation/continuum/" rel="external" class="ui-link">SCUBA-2</a>
and <a href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/instrumentation/heterodyne/" rel="external" class="ui-link">ACSIS</a> instrument pages provided on the EAO 
maintained <a rel="external" href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/" class="ui-link">JCMT</a> pages.  
<a rel="external" href="http://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/science/archive/" class="ui-link">JCMT-specific
help</a> related to the use of the CADC AdvancedSearch tool is available
from the <a rel="external" hef="https://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/science/archive/" class="ui-link">EAO</a>.
</p>

<p> Programmatic access to the complete JCMT archive is also available
via the CADC <a href="/tap/" class="ui-link">Table Access Protocol</a> (TAP).  TAP is
an <a rel="external" href="http://www.ivoa.net" class="ui-link">IVOA</a> standards
based approach to querying remote databases. The contents accessible
via TAP are identical to those presented using the AdvancedSearch
interface.  To learn the structure of queries that can be made using
the TAP service see the 'Query' tab on the
CADC <a href="/en/search/" class="ui-link">Search</a> page.
</p>

<p> All accessible JCMT observations are available through the
AdvancedSearch interface, including spectral datacubes produced by
ACSIS as well as images taken with the
SCUBA-2 camera. The raw observations are available in 
<a rel="external" href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/docs/sun33.htx/node3.html#NDF" class="ui-link">
NDF</a> format.  Each ACSIS and SCUBA-2 observation is also available as reduced products 
in FITS format with a full set of world coordinate system headers.
</p>

<p> All public JCMT data can be downloaded freely from the CADC.
Observation products remain proprietary as long as the raw data from
which they were derived remains proprietary. Users authorized to
access these data should log in using their CADC username and
password, after which they will be able to search for and download
proprietary data from all JCMT projects of which they are members.
