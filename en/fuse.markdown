<p>
  FUSE was a NASA space telescope, led by Johns Hopkins University
  (JHU), and built in collaboration with the Canadian and French space
  agencies. It undertook high-resolution spectroscopic observations in
  the far-ultraviolet from 1999 to 2007, significantly exceeding its
  originally planned 3-year lifetime.
