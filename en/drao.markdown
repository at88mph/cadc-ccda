This page presents World-Wide-Web links to the data archives of the Dominion
Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO).
</p>

<p>
DRAO is an internationally known facility for science and technology research and development related to
radio astronomy. Home to NRC astronomers, astrophysicists, engineers and technologists, as well as
visiting researchers and students from universities and astronomical observatories around the world,
these facilities support the design and development of leading-edge instrumentation for new and existing
telescopes. Operating several telescopes on its extensive radio-quiet site near Penticton BC, DRAO also
features laboratories and specialized equipment for design and construction of all aspects of radio-frequency
instrumentation, from highly sensitive antennas and receiver systems to high speed digital signal processing
hardware and software.

<p>
    DRAO capabilities include:
    </p><ul>
        <li>
            <b>John A. Galt Telescope:</b> a 26-m diameter, prime-focus, equatorially mounted telescope with
            interchangeable feeds that operate from 0.4 to 2 GHz.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Synthesis Telescope:</b> a 7-element array of 9-m telescopes that offers wide-field continuum
            imaging simultaneously at 408 MHz and 1420 MHz, as well as atomic hydrogen (HI) spectroscopy
            across 256 channels at 1420 MHz.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Solar radio flux monitoring:</b> a fully automated solar weather monitoring facility
            that provides "space weather" data for many scientific and commercial activities at both
            industrial organizations and government agencies around the world.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME):</b>
            Canada's largest radio telescope, CHIME is a collaboration
            between the University of British Columbia, McGill University and the University of Toronto. Collecting
            radio emissions from the Universe between 400 and 800 MHz, it is designed to survey atomic hydrogen
            from the largest volume of the Universe to date.
        </li>
    </ul>
