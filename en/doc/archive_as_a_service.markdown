<p>
Archive as a Service (AaaS) refers to the process whereby the CADC
provides Telescopes with storage and search capacity for the data
collections and those users manage the storage of their data and
creation of metadata records that describe the data.  This process
enables the CADC to provide hosting to an ever growing number of diverse
data collections without requiring an ever growing staff to support
that activity.  In particular, the expert knowledge concerning the
observational data is kept at the data provider, enabling highly
diverse data collections to be serviced by a single data archive
service. AaaS allows many facilities to preserve and distribute datasets
that might otherwise not be archived.
</p>

<p>
Facilities that wish to use the CADC Archive Service should contact the <a href="mailto:support@canfar.net">CADC</a> directly.  
CADC will provide information on how to request a new archive
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>From an Archive Data Provider perspective, the AaaS requires one to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Storing the file into the <a href="../ad">archive storage</a></li>
    <li>Mapping the observational meta data to the <a href="../caom2">Common Archive Observation Model (v2)</a></li>
    <li>Storing the meta-data mapping to the <a href="../repo">CAOM repository</a></li>
    <li>Assigning any <a href="../props">proprietary</a> data access</li>
</ul>
