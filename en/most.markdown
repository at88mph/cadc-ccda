<p>
This page provides access to the Microvariability and Oscillations
of Stars (MOST) data collection.
</p>

<p>
MOST is a Canadian microsatellite designed to monitor optical
variability in a few stellar targets for up to 60 days. As the
first telescope dedicated to asteroseismology, it was a pathfinder
for the subsequent COROT and Kepler missions and is still in operation.
