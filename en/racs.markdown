<p>
  The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) is the first large sky survey using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), owned and operated by Australia's national science agency, CSIRO.  It and will ultimately survey a contiguous region in the 
  declination range -90 deg to +47 deg in three frequency bands (RACS-low: 887.5 MHz, RACS-mid: 1367.5 MHz and RACS-high: 1655.5 MHz).  RACS Data Release 1 includes initial observations made 
  for RACS-low (central frequency of 887.5 MHz) and is comprised of 903 tiles in the declination range -90 deg to +41 deg (the original observations and images are available through the CSIRO 
  ASKAP Science Data Archive). A subset of 799 tiles in the declination range -80 deg to +30 deg were convolved to a common resolution of 25” to allow mosaicking of neighbouring tiles and to 
  generate a catalogue with consistent resolution. The convolved and mosaicked tiles have a median one-sigma sensitivity of ~300 µJy/beam and are made available through this service.

      The ASKAP radio telescope is part of the Australia Telescope National Facility which is managed by Australia's national science agency, CSIRO. Operation of ASKAP is funded by the 
      Australian Government with support from the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. ASKAP uses the resources of the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre. 
      Establishment of ASKAP, the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory and the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre are initiatives of the Australian Government, with support from the 
      Government of Western Australia and the Science and Industry Endowment Fund. We acknowledge the Wajarri Yamatji people as the traditional owners of the Observatory site.
