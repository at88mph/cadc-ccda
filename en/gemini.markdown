<p>
    This page provides access to data from the Gemini Observatory.  The Observatory
    has deployed a new archive service
    <a rel="external" href="http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/data-and-results/gemini-observatory-archive">described here</a>
    and it can be accessed from the link in the menu to the left.  All proprietary 
    data must now be retrieved using this service.
</p>
<p>
    The CADC will continue to provide access to public Gemini data through its
    <a href="/en/search/?collection=GEMINI&noexec=true">Advanced Search</a> 
    service.  For convenience a link to a search page for the Gemini 
    collection is provided in the menu to the left.
