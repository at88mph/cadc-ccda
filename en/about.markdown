        The Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) was established in 1986 by the
        <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/" title="National Research Council of Canada (NRC)" rel="external">National Research Council of Canada (NRC)</a>,
        through a grant provided by the
        <a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/" title="Canadian Space Agency (CSA)" rel="external">Canadian Space Agency (CSA)</a>.
        Over the past 30 years the CADC has evolved from an archiving centre - hosting
        data from Hubble Space Telescope, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the Gemini observatories,
        and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope - into a Science Platform for data-intensive astronomy.
        The CADC, in partnership with Shared Services Canada, Compute Canada, CANARIE and the
        university community (funded through the Canadian Foundation for Innovation), offers
        cloud computing, user-managed storage, group management, and data publication services,
        in addition to its ongoing mission to provide permanent storage for major data collections.
        </p>

        Located at NRC Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre in Victoria, BC, the CADC
        staff consists of professional astronomers, software developers, and operations staff who
        work with the community to develop and deliver leading-edge services to advance Canadian research.
        The CADC plays a leading role in international efforts to improve the scientific/technical
        landscape that supports data intensive science. This includes leadership roles in the
        International Virtual Observatory Alliance and participation in organizations like
        the Research Data Alliance, CODATA, and the World Data Systems. CADC also contributes significantly
        to future Canadian projects like the Square Kilometre Array and TMT.

        In 2019, the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) delivered over <span class="strong">2 Petabytes
        of data (over 200 million individual files)</span> to thousands of astronomers in Canada and in over
        80 other countries. The cloud processing system completed over <span class="strong">6 million jobs
        (over 1100 core years)</span> in 2019.
