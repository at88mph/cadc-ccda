The Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) is designed to optimize science from the Hubble Space Telescope by providing online, enhanced Hubble products and advanced browsing capabilities. The HLA is a joint project of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC).
</p>
<p>
The goal of the HLA is to optimize science from the Hubble Space Telescope by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting the data online for immediate access</li>
<li>Providing more extensive "composite images" (e.g., stacked, color, mosaics)</li>
<li>Improving absolute astrometry from ~1-2" to ~0.3"</li>
<li>Extracting spectra from ACS and NICMOS grism data (produced at ST-ECF)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Currently we have enhanced image products for ACS, WFPC2, WFC3, and NICMOS, extracted spectra from NICMOS and ACS grism observations.
</p>
<p>
The enhanced data products were generated from the standard HST pipeline
products. The ACS, WFPC2, and WFC3, and NICMOS images have been combined
using MultiDrizzle, are aligned north up, and, except for WFC3, have
been astrometrically corrected when possible (for approximately 80% of
the cases). 
</p>
<p>
All HLA-produced images are in units
of electrons/second, which for WFPC2 and NICMOS differs from calibration
pipeline products; photometric zeropoints must be adjusted to reflect
the units used.
</p>
<p>
Observations can be queried by various criteria such as object name, position, instrument, etc. and retrieved using the following links:

<h2>The Hubble Legacy Archive at CADC contains the following data:</h2>
<ul>
   <li>ACS, Nicmos, WFC3 imaging data produced by the STScI</li>
   <li>WFPC2 imaging data produced by the CADC</li>
   <li>ACS and Nicmos Grism data produced by the now defunct ST-ECF</li>
</ul>
