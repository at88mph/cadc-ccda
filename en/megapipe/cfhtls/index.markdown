<p>
This page presents stacked MegaCam images and catalogues
produced by the MegaPipe pipeline at the CADC.
MegaPipe takes the 
<a rel="external" href="https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Elixir/">Elixir
processed images</a> produced by CFHT and combines them.  To read
a more detailed description, consult the
<a href="/en/megapipe/docs/intro.html">Documentation</a>, available through the
links on the toolbar on the left.  To search for MegaPipe images,
use the
<a href="/en/search/?collection=CFHTMEGAPIPE&amp;noexec=true">image search</a> page on the
left hand toolbar.  You can also use the 
<a href="/en/megapipe/access/cut.html">image cutout service</a> or
the <a href="/en/megapipe/access/graph.html">MegaCam Graphical
Search Tool</a>.
